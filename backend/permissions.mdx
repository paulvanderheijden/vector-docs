title: "Access Control Spec"
description: "The authoritative access control specification for Vector — defines who can read, write, and manage every entity."
---

This document is the **single source of truth** for access control in Vector. Both the backend (API enforcement) and frontend (UI gating) must conform to the rules defined here. Permissions are **derived from relationships** — there are no explicit permission tables.

## Principles

1. **No permission tables.** Access is derived from workspace membership, circle membership, and entity-role assignments (requestor, sponsor, owner).
2. **Circles are restricted.** Non-members cannot see that a circle exists, with one exception: the circle picker during decision creation shows circle names to all workspace members (for routing purposes only).
3. **Anyone can route decisions anywhere.** Any workspace member can create a draft decision and route it to any circle — even one they're not a member of. The draft is visible only to the requestor in My Items.
4. **Initiatives and projects are workspace-scoped.** All workspace members can see them. Linked decisions/commitments from restricted circles are filtered out per the reader's circle memberships.
5. **Entity-role access.** A person who holds a role on a specific entity (requestor, sponsor, owner) can access that entity regardless of circle membership.

## Roles

| Role | Source | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Workspace Member** | `WorkspaceMember.is_active = True` | Base workspace access |
| **Workspace Admin** | `WorkspaceMember.role = "admin"` | Workspace management (superset of Workspace Member) |
| **Circle Member** | `CircleMembership` record exists | Circle content access |
| **Circle Chair** | `CircleMembership.is_chair = True` | Circle management (superset of Circle Member) |
| **Entity Role** | `requestor` / `sponsor` / `owner` FK on entity | Access to that specific entity only |

These are **not hierarchical levels** — they are independent contexts that combine. The same person can be admin of the workspace, chair of one circle, a regular member of another, and have no access to a third.

## Read Access

| Entity | Who can read |
|---|---|
| Workspace list | Authenticated user (own workspaces only) |
| People list | Workspace member |
| Circle metadata (name, icon, cadence) | Circle members and workspace admins only. **Exception:** circle picker during decision creation shows circle names to all workspace members. |
| Circle content (decisions, commitments, sessions, members) | Circle member |
| Decisions in a circle | Circle member (excludes Drafts — Drafts visible only to requestor) |
| Own decisions (My Items) | Requestor, sponsor, or owner — regardless of circle membership |
| Commitments in a circle | Circle member |
| Own commitments (My Items) | Commitment owner — regardless of circle membership |
| Sessions in a circle | Circle member |
| Initiatives | All workspace members |
| Projects | All workspace members |
| Project → linked decisions | Only decisions from circles the user is a member of (or where the user has a role on that decision) |
| Project → linked commitments | Only commitments from circles the user is a member of (or where the user has a role on that commitment) |
| Updates | All workspace members |
| Strategy | All workspace members |

## Write Access — Decisions

| Action | Who |
|---|---|
| Create draft | Any workspace member (becomes requestor). Can route to any circle. |
| Edit draft (statement, description, circle) | Requestor |
| Submit (Draft → Requested) | Requestor |
| View in circle (Requested+) | Circle member |
| Schedule (Requested → Scheduled) | Circle chair |
| Assign sponsor | Circle chair |
| Take (Scheduled → Taken) | Circle chair |
| Assign owner | Circle chair |
| Roll (Scheduled → Rolled) | Circle chair |
| Supersede | Circle chair |
| Edit description, discussion, summary (non-Draft) | Sponsor, owner, or circle chair |
| Delete draft | Requestor |

## Write Access — Commitments

| Action | Who |
|---|---|
| Create (in open session) | Any circle member |
| Create (standalone, outside session) | Circle chair |
| Edit outcome, description | Owner or circle chair |
| Change status (Active → Delivered) | Owner or circle chair |
| Roll (Active → Rolled) | Circle chair |
| Reassign owner | Circle chair |
| Delete | Circle chair |

## Write Access — Sessions

| Action | Who |
|---|---|
| Create | Circle chair |
| Edit title, date | Circle chair |
| Assign/change chair | Circle chair or workspace admin |
| Add/remove/reorder decisions on agenda | Circle chair |
| Add/remove commitments | Circle chair |
| Edit meeting notes | Any circle member (while session is Open) |
| Close (Open → Closed) | Circle chair |
| Cancel (Open → Cancelled) | Circle chair |
| Reopen (Closed/Cancelled → Open) | Circle chair |

## Write Access — Initiatives

| Action | Who |
|---|---|
| Create | Workspace admin |
| Edit (title, summary, description, status, target, icon) | Initiative owner or workspace admin |
| Assign/change owner | Workspace admin |
| Delete | Workspace admin |

## Write Access — Projects

| Action | Who |
|---|---|
| Create | Workspace admin or initiative owner |
| Edit (title, description) | Project owner or workspace admin |
| Assign/change owner | Workspace admin or initiative owner |
| Link to initiative | Workspace admin or initiative owner |
| Delete | Workspace admin |

## Write Access — Updates

| Action | Who |
|---|---|
| Create (for initiative) | Initiative owner or workspace admin |
| Create (for project) | Project owner or workspace admin |
| Edit | Author |
| Delete | Author or workspace admin |

## Write Access — Strategy

| Action | Who |
|---|---|
| Edit | Workspace admin |

## Write Access — Workspace Administration

| Action | Who |
|---|---|
| Edit workspace settings | Workspace admin |
| Invite member | Workspace admin |
| Disable member | Workspace admin |
| Change member role | Workspace admin |
| Create/edit/delete circles | Workspace admin |
| Manage circle membership | Workspace admin or circle chair (own circle) |
| Set/unset chair | Workspace admin |

## Validation Rules (FK Constraints)

These rules ensure data integrity and must be enforced in serializers/views on every write.

| Rule | Enforced on |
|---|---|
| Decision sponsor must be a member of the decision's circle | Assign sponsor |
| Decision owner must be a member of the decision's circle | Assign owner |
| Commitment owner must be a member of the commitment's circle | Create / reassign |
| Session chair must be a member of the session's circle | Assign chair |
| Decision can only be scheduled to a session in the same circle | Schedule |
| Commitment circle must match its linked decision's circle (if linked) | Create / link |

## Membership Lifecycle

| Event | Effect |
|---|---|
| Added to circle | Immediately sees all circle content |
| Removed from circle | Loses circle access. Existing role assignments (sponsor, owner) remain but should be reassigned. |
| Made chair | Gains management capabilities in that circle |
| Unset as chair | Loses management capabilities, retains member access |
| Disabled in workspace | Loses **all** access. Historical references preserved. Active roles should be reassigned. |
