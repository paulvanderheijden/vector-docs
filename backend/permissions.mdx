description: "How user permissions are derived from data relationships — not assigned as roles."
---

Vector does not have an explicit permissions model with role-per-user assignments. Instead, permissions are **derived** from the user's relationship to entities in the system. What a person can do depends on where they are: which workspace they belong to, which circles they're in, and what role they hold in each.

## Permission contexts

A person's capabilities change based on context. The same person can be an organizer in one circle, a regular member in another, and have no access to a third.

| Context | Derived from | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Workspace Member** | `WorkspaceMember` record exists | Base access — the person is in the workspace |
| **Circle Member** | Listed in `circle.members` with role `Member` | Can see and participate in circle activity |
| **Circle Organizer** | Listed in `circle.members` with role `Organizer` | Can manage sessions and agendas |
| **Workspace Admin** | `WorkspaceMember.role = Admin` | Can manage workspace settings and people |

These are not levels in a hierarchy — they're independent contexts that combine. A person could be a workspace admin, an organizer in MT Weekly, a regular member in Product Forum, and have no access to People & Org.

| Create/edit/delete circles | — | yes |
| Manage circle membership | — | yes |
| Create/edit initiatives | — | yes |

## How permissions are derived

There are no permission tables. The system checks relationships at query time:

```
Can this person see decisions in MT Weekly?
  → Is the person in mt_weekly.members?
    → Yes → allow
    → No → deny

Can this person be assigned as sponsor for a decision in Product Forum?
  → Is the person in product_forum.members?
    → Yes → allow
    → No → deny

Can this person schedule decisions for a session?
  → Is the person in the circle's members with role = Organizer?
    → Yes → allow
    → No → deny

Can this person invite new members to the workspace?
  → Is the person's WorkspaceMember.role = Admin?
    → Yes → allow
    → No → deny
```

## Key constraints

| Rule | Enforced by |
|---|---|
| A decision sponsor must be a member of the decision's circle | `sponsorPersonId` must be in `circle.members` (set when Scheduled) |
| A commitment owner must be a member of the review circle | `ownerPersonId` must be in `reviewCircle.members` |
| Circle content is only visible to circle members | Query filtering by membership |
| Only organizers can manage session agendas | Role check on `circle.members` |
| Only workspace admins can manage workspace settings | Role check on `WorkspaceMember` |

## Soft-delete and disabled members

Workspace members are never hard-deleted. When a person is removed from a workspace, their `workspace_members.status` is set to `Disabled`. The RLS helper function `is_workspace_member()` only returns true for members with `status = 'Active'`, which immediately revokes all permissions derived from workspace membership.

Historical references (e.g., requestor or sponsor on past decisions) remain intact because the person record is not deleted.

## What happens when membership changes

| Event | Effect |
|---|---|
| Person removed from a circle | Loses access to circle content. Existing sponsorships and commitment ownerships remain but should be reassigned. |
| Person added to a circle | Immediately sees all circle content (decisions, commitments, sessions). |
| Person promoted to organizer | Gains session management capabilities in that circle. |
| Person demoted from organizer to member | Loses session management capabilities but retains all member access. |
| Person disabled in workspace | Loses all active access (soft-delete via `status = 'Disabled'`). Historical references preserved. Active decision ownerships and commitment ownerships must be reassigned — the reassignment flow is not yet designed (deferred). |

## Why not explicit roles?

An explicit permission model (e.g., role-based access control with a permissions table) would require maintaining role assignments separately from the data. In Vector, the data *is* the permission model:

- Being in a circle's member list = having circle access
- Having the organizer role = having management rights
- Being a workspace admin = having workspace management rights

This means there's no drift between "what the system thinks you can do" and "what your actual relationship to the data is." When a person leaves a circle, their permissions are gone — there's no orphaned role entry to clean up.
