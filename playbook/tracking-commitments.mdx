Commitments are how decisions become action. Every commitment in Vector has a single owner, a due date, and a review circle. Follow-up isn't a separate activity — it's built into the session rhythm.

## The follow-up loop

Commitments are reviewed in sessions. This means follow-up happens automatically at the cadence of the review circle:

| Circle cadence | Follow-up frequency |
|---|---|
| Weekly | Every week |
| Biweekly | Every two weeks |
| Monthly | Every month |

There are no separate check-ins, no "just following up" messages, no status request emails. The session is where accountability happens.

## What the owner does

As a commitment owner, your job is simple:

1. **Do the work** — deliver the outcome by the due date
2. **Flag risks early** — if you're going to miss the date, change your commitment status to **At risk** before the session. Don't surprise the forum.
3. **Show up to the review** — be ready to give a 30-second update in the session

<Tip>
  The best commitment owners update the status *before* the session. When the facilitator opens your commitment and it's already marked "Delivered" or "At risk," it shows you're on top of it. When the facilitator has to ask "so, where are we on this?" — that's a bad signal.
</Tip>

## What the forum does

During each session, the circle reviews its commitments. For each one:

| Status | Forum action |
|---|---|
| **Active** (on track) | Acknowledge, move on. 10 seconds. |
| **Active** (update needed) | Owner gives a quick update. Under a minute. |
| **At risk** | Discuss the risk. Decide: adjust the due date, add support, or raise a decision to change course. |
| **Rolled** | This is the critical one. The commitment missed its date. The forum must decide: new due date, reassign, escalate, or kill it. |
| **Delivered** | Celebrate briefly. Close it. Move on. |

## The roll: how Vector handles slippage

When a due date passes without delivery, the commitment automatically moves to **Rolled**. This is deliberate — the system doesn't quietly extend deadlines.

A roll is visible:
- In the session's commitment list
- On the owner's personal dashboard
- In the circle's commitment view

### How to handle a roll

<Steps>
  <Step title="Acknowledge it">
    Don't explain it away. The commitment rolled. That's a fact.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Diagnose the cause">
    Was it underestimated? Was it deprioritized? Was there a blocker? Is it still the right thing to do?
  </Step>
  <Step title="Decide the next step">
    The forum picks one:

    - **Reset** — set a new due date with a concrete plan to deliver
    - **Reassign** — the current owner can't deliver; assign to someone who can
    - **Escalate** — raise a decision to address the underlying problem
    - **Kill** — the commitment is no longer relevant; close it without delivery
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  A commitment that has rolled 3+ times is a systemic problem, not an execution issue. Stop resetting the due date and raise a decision to address the root cause.
</Warning>

## Commitment hygiene

### Keep commitments concrete

| Good | Bad |
|---|---|
| "Deliver build vs. buy analysis with cost comparison" | "Look into analytics options" |
| "Present enterprise pricing to 5 prospects" | "Work on pricing" |
| "DACH go-live with 3 pilot customers" | "Make progress on DACH" |

A good commitment describes an **outcome you can verify**. If you can't tell whether it's done, it's not specific enough.

### Keep due dates real

Don't set aspirational due dates. Set dates you can actually hit. It's better to commit to "End Q1" and deliver than to commit to "Feb 14" and roll three times.

### One owner, always

Every commitment has exactly one owner. Not "the team." Not "Product and Engineering." One person. If the work requires multiple people, the owner is the one who's accountable for coordinating and delivering.

## The CEO's commitment dashboard

As CEO, you should regularly check:

1. **Your own commitments** — are you delivering on what you committed to?
2. **Rolled commitments across all circles** — where is execution slipping?
3. **At-risk commitments** — what might roll next session?
4. **Commitment density per person** — is anyone overloaded?

You don't need to manage commitments directly. The system creates accountability through the session rhythm. Your job is to read the signals and intervene with decisions when the pattern shows a problem.
