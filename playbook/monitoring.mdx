Setting strategy is the easy part. The hard part is knowing whether execution is on track — and acting quickly when it isn't. Vector makes the health of your company's execution visible at every level.

## The monitoring rhythm

| Frequency | What you check | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **Daily** | Your personal dashboard — decisions you own, commitments due | My Items |
| **Weekly** | Circle sessions — decisions on the agenda, commitments under review | Session detail |
| **Biweekly / Monthly** | Initiative and project health — updates, stalled work, aging decisions | Initiative & Project views |

## Signals that something is wrong

Vector doesn't send you alerts. Instead, it makes problems visible through natural signals:

### Aging decisions

A decision that's been in **Draft** for 10+ days hasn't been prepared. A decision in **Proposed** for 3+ weeks hasn't been resolved. The age counter is always visible — stale decisions are a sign that the circle isn't working.

**What to do:** The decision owner should either push it to the next session agenda or escalate it. If the owner is inactive, the circle lead should reassign.

### Rolled commitments

A commitment that has **Rolled** means someone missed a due date. One roll is normal — life happens. Multiple rolls on the same commitment means execution is broken.

**What to do:** In the next session, the forum should decide: reset the due date with a concrete plan, reassign the commitment, or raise a new decision to change course.

### Empty sessions

A circle that meets on cadence but has nothing on the agenda is a circle that doesn't need to exist — or one where people aren't routing decisions to it.

**What to do:** Either dissolve the circle, change its cadence, or actively route decisions to it.

### No project updates

A project with no recent updates is a project nobody is paying attention to. This is the most subtle signal — absence of information is the problem.

**What to do:** The project lead should post an update. If they don't, the initiative owner should follow up. If the project is truly stalled, raise a decision.

## From signal to intervention

When you spot a problem, the intervention is always the same: **raise a decision**.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Spot the signal">
    Aging decision, rolled commitment, stalled project, or missing update.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Raise a decision">
    Create a decision that frames the problem: "We need to decide whether to continue, pivot, or kill project X."
  </Step>
  <Step title="Route to the right circle">
    Put it on the agenda of the circle with the right people to resolve it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Resolve in session">
    The circle discusses and takes the decision. Commitments are created to execute the new direction.
  </Step>
</Steps>

This is the core loop of Vector: **monitoring reveals problems → problems become decisions → decisions produce commitments → commitments are monitored.**

## The CEO's view

As CEO, your monitoring checklist is:

1. **How many decisions are aging?** — If the number is growing, forums aren't resolving fast enough
2. **How many commitments have rolled?** — If rolls are increasing, execution is slipping
3. **Are all circles meeting on cadence?** — If sessions are being skipped, accountability is eroding
4. **Are initiatives on track?** — Check project updates and the commitments tied to each initiative

You don't need to attend every session. You need to read the signals and intervene (by raising decisions) when the system shows stress.
