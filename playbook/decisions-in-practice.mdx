Decisions are the primary way work gets unblocked in Vector. Anyone in the organization can raise a decision — it doesn't require a title or a meeting. The system routes it to the right people and ensures it gets resolved.

## Who can raise a decision?

Any **workspace member**. A team lead whose project is blocked. An IC who spotted a risk. A VP who sees a strategic fork. The CEO who needs alignment.

The person who raises it is the **requestor**. They are not automatically the sponsor or owner — they're creating pull: "we need a decision on X because Y is blocked." The draft is visible only to the requestor in My Items until it's formally submitted.

## How to raise a decision

<Steps>
  <Step title="Write a clear title">
    Frame the decision as a statement, not a question. Good titles are actionable and specific.

    | Good | Bad |
    |---|---|
    | "Prioritize DACH launch over Nordics expansion" | "What should we do about international?" |
    | "Hire external CISO vs. promote internal" | "We need to figure out security" |
    | "Kill the mobile app MVP" | "Mobile app discussion" |
  </Step>
  <Step title="Route to a circle">
    Choose the circle where this decision should be discussed. You can route to **any circle** — even one you're not a member of. Ask: **who needs to be in the room to make this call?** The circle chair will assign a sponsor when scheduling the decision for a session.

    | Decision type | Typical circle |
    |---|---|
    | Cross-functional, resource allocation | MT Weekly |
    | Product and engineering | Product Forum |
    | Go-to-market, commercial | GTM Council |
    | People, org design | People & Org |
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add context (optional)">
    Link the decision to an initiative or project for strategic context. Add any background the circle will need.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What happens next

Once raised, the decision enters the [decision lifecycle](/lifecycle/decision-lifecycle):

1. It starts as **Draft** while the requestor gathers context (visible only to the requestor)
2. The **requestor** moves it to **Requested** when it's ready for the circle (now visible to circle members)
3. The **circle chair** places it on a session's agenda (**Scheduled**) and assigns a sponsor
4. The circle discusses and the **circle chair** resolves it (Taken or Rolled)

## How decisions get resolved in a session

During a session, the facilitator works through the decision agenda. For each decision:

1. The sponsor presents the context and options
2. The circle discusses
3. One of two outcomes:

| Outcome | What happens |
|---|---|
| **Taken** | The circle makes the call. Commitments are created to execute. The decision is closed. |
| **Rolled** | The circle didn't resolve it. The decision carries over to the next session with the age counter still ticking. |

## Closing the loop with the requestor

When a decision is taken, the requestor can see the outcome. The commitments that flow from the decision show who's doing what and by when. The requestor doesn't need to chase — the system makes the outcome visible.

If the decision was rolled, the requestor can see it's still in progress. The age counter keeps ticking — creating visible pressure for resolution.

## Common patterns

### The blocked project

A project lead can't proceed without a call from leadership.

→ They raise a decision, route it to the relevant circle, and it's on the next session's agenda. No Slack thread, no hallway conversation, no waiting for someone to "find time."

### The strategic fork

The CEO sees two paths and needs MT alignment.

→ They raise a decision in MT Weekly. The sponsor (often the CEO for cross-cutting decisions) prepares the options. The MT discusses and takes the decision. Commitments are created for the chosen path.

### The recurring problem

A commitment keeps rolling. The same issue keeps coming back.

→ Someone raises a decision to address the root cause: "Restructure the CS team under Commercial" or "Hire a dedicated lead for X." This turns a recurring execution problem into a one-time decision.

### The revisit

A previous decision isn't working out.

→ A new decision is raised with a **revisit link** to the original. This preserves the history and makes it clear: we're not ignoring the original call, we're deliberately reconsidering it.
