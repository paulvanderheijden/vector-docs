Decisions are the primary way work gets unblocked in Vector. Anyone in the organization can raise a decision — it doesn't require a title or a meeting. The system routes it to the right people and ensures it gets resolved.

## Who can raise a decision?

Anyone. A team lead whose project is blocked. An IC who spotted a risk. A VP who sees a strategic fork. The CEO who needs alignment.

The person who raises it is the **requestor**. They are not automatically the owner — they're creating pull: "we need a decision on X because Y is blocked."

## How to raise a decision

<Steps>
  <Step title="Write a clear statement">
    Frame the decision as a statement, not a question. Good statements are actionable and specific.

    | Good | Bad |
    |---|---|
    | "Prioritize DACH launch over Nordics expansion" | "What should we do about international?" |
    | "Hire external CISO vs. promote internal" | "We need to figure out security" |
    | "Kill the mobile app MVP" | "Mobile app discussion" |
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set the owner">
    Assign a decision owner — the person accountable for getting this resolved. Default: the person accountable for the initiative this decision affects. If unsure, assign it to the circle lead.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Route to a circle">
    Choose the circle where this decision should be discussed. Ask: **who needs to be in the room to make this call?**

    | Decision type | Typical circle |
    |---|---|
    | Cross-functional, resource allocation | MT Weekly |
    | Product and engineering | Product Forum |
    | Go-to-market, commercial | GTM Council |
    | People, org design | People & Org |
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add context (optional)">
    Link the decision to an initiative or project for strategic context. Add any background the forum will need.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What happens next

Once raised, the decision enters the [decision lifecycle](/lifecycle/decision-lifecycle):

1. It starts as **Draft** while the owner prepares it
2. The owner moves it to **Proposed** when it's ready for the circle
3. It appears on the next session's agenda
4. The circle discusses and resolves it

## How decisions get resolved in a session

During a session, the facilitator works through the decision agenda. For each decision:

1. The owner presents the context and options
2. The circle discusses
3. One of three outcomes:

| Outcome | What happens |
|---|---|
| **Taken** | The circle makes the call. Commitments are created to execute. The decision is closed. |
| **Escalated** | The circle can't resolve it. The decision moves to a higher-level circle (e.g., Product Forum → MT Weekly). |
| **Delegated** | The circle pushes it down. The decision moves to a more specific circle or individual. |

## Closing the loop with the requestor

When a decision is taken, the requestor can see the outcome. The commitments that flow from the decision show who's doing what and by when. The requestor doesn't need to chase — the system makes the outcome visible.

If the decision was escalated or delegated, the requestor can track it as it moves through the system. The age counter keeps ticking regardless of where it lives.

## Common patterns

### The blocked project

A project lead can't proceed without a call from leadership.

→ They raise a decision, route it to the relevant circle, and it's on the next session's agenda. No Slack thread, no hallway conversation, no waiting for someone to "find time."

### The strategic fork

The CEO sees two paths and needs MT alignment.

→ They raise a decision in MT Weekly. The owner (often the CEO for cross-cutting decisions) prepares the options. The MT discusses and takes the decision. Commitments are created for the chosen path.

### The recurring problem

A commitment keeps rolling. The same issue keeps coming back.

→ Someone raises a decision to address the root cause: "Restructure the CS team under Commercial" or "Hire a dedicated lead for X." This turns a recurring execution problem into a one-time decision.

### The revisit

A previous decision isn't working out.

→ A new decision is raised with a **revisit link** to the original. This preserves the history and makes it clear: we're not ignoring the original call, we're deliberately reconsidering it.
