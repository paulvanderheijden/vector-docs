Strategy in Vector starts with **initiatives** — the 3-6 strategic bets your company is making this quarter or year. Each initiative breaks down into **projects** — concrete streams of work with a lead and a team.

This isn't a strategy document. It's a living structure that every decision and commitment can link back to.

## Step 1: Define your initiatives

Start by answering: **what are the 3-6 things that matter most right now?**

Good initiatives are:
- **Outcome-oriented** — "Launch DACH market by end of Q1" not "Work on DACH"
- **Time-bound** — they have a target date (month, quarter, or year)
- **Countable** — you should be able to list them on one hand

<Warning>
  If you have more than 6 active initiatives, you haven't prioritized. The power of Vector is making the few things that matter visible — not tracking everything.
</Warning>

### In Vector

Create each initiative with:
- A clear name that states the outcome
- A status: **Planned** (not started), **Active** (in progress), or **Completed**
- A target date
- Optionally link circles to restrict visibility (no circles = visible to everyone)

## Step 2: Break initiatives into projects

Each initiative contains one or more projects. Projects are the execution containers — they have a lead, a team, and regular updates.

**Example:**

| Initiative | Projects |
|---|---|
| Launch DACH market by end of Q1 | DACH Sales Pipeline, DACH Legal & Compliance, DACH Product Localization |
| Ship enterprise tier | Enterprise SSO, Portfolio Analytics, Enterprise Pricing |
| Reduce churn from 8% to 5% | Churn Root Cause Analysis, Customer Health Scoring, Retention Playbook |

Every project belongs to exactly one initiative. This forces clarity: if a project doesn't map to an initiative, either the project shouldn't exist or you're missing an initiative.

## Step 3: Assign ownership

Every project needs a lead — one person, not a committee.

| Level | Owner | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Project | Project lead | Responsible for delivery. Posts updates. Flags risks. |

## Step 4: Connect to circles

Decide which [circle](/concepts/circles) will monitor each initiative. Typically:

- **MT Weekly** monitors all active initiatives at a high level
- **Functional circles** (Product Forum, GTM Council) monitor the projects within their domain
- **Review circles** (People & Org, QBR) do deep-dive reviews on a slower cadence

This mapping determines where decisions about the initiative get routed and where commitments get reviewed.

## Step 5: Review and adjust quarterly

At the end of each quarter:

1. Mark completed initiatives as **Completed**
2. Assess whether active initiatives are still the right bets
3. Add new initiatives for the next period
4. Archive or restructure projects that no longer serve an active initiative

The initiative list should always reflect **what the company is actually betting on right now** — not a backlog of ideas.
