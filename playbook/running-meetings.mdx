In Vector, meetings are called **sessions**. A session is not a calendar event — it's a structured record of what your circle discussed, decided, and committed to. Vector is open during the meeting and serves as the primary workspace.

## Before the session

### 1. Set the agenda (circle chair)

The agenda is the list of decisions on the session. Only the **circle chair** can add, remove, and reorder decisions on the agenda.

In the session detail page:
- Decisions are listed in a reorderable table
- Drag decisions to set the discussion order — put the most important or time-sensitive items first
- Click **Add Decision** to pull in decisions that are ready for discussion

<Tip>
  A good agenda has 3-5 decisions. More than that and the session will run over or rush through important items. If you have too many, prioritize ruthlessly — the rest will age and create natural pressure for the next session.
</Tip>

### 2. Review commitments

Check which commitments are due for review. These appear in the commitments section of the session. Look for:

- Commitments that have **Rolled** — these need resolution
- Commitments that are **Active** and approaching their due date — these need discussion time
- Commitments that are **Active** and on track — these can be acknowledged quickly

### 3. Prime the participants

If a decision requires pre-reading or context, the decision sponsor should prepare that before the session. The session is for discussing and deciding — not for presenting information for the first time.

## During the session

### Open Vector on the session detail page

The session detail page is your meeting workspace. It shows:
- The **session title** (editable) at the top
- The **decisions** on the agenda in discussion order
- The **commitments** under review
- A **meeting notes** editor at the bottom

### Work through decisions

For each decision on the agenda:

1. **Click the decision** to open the detail drawer — this shows the rationale, implications, and discussion context
2. **Discuss** — the facilitator guides the conversation toward a resolution
3. **Decide** — the circle chair marks the decision as Taken (assigning an owner), or rolls it to the next session
4. **Create commitments** — if the decision is taken, any circle member can create commitments with owners and due dates while the session is open

<Note>
  Don't defer commitment creation to "after the meeting." The best time to assign commitments is when the decision is fresh and the owners are in the room. If you leave the session without commitments, the decision is just words.
</Note>

### Review commitments

For each commitment under review:

1. **Check status** — is it Active or Rolled?
2. **Get a 30-second update** from the owner — on track, behind, or done?
3. **Update the status** — the owner or circle chair marks it Delivered if done, or the circle chair rolls it if overdue

### Capture notes

Any circle member can edit meeting notes while the session is open. Use the editor for:
- Key discussion points that aren't captured in decisions or commitments
- Context for future reference ("Sara flagged that vendor contract expires in March")
- Action items that are too small for formal commitments

## After the session

### Verify the record

The session detail page is now the record of what happened. Check that:
- All decisions have an updated status
- New commitments have been created with owners and due dates
- Meeting notes capture anything important that isn't in the formal objects

### No follow-up emails needed

The decisions, commitments, and notes are all in Vector. Everyone who was in the session can see them. Everyone who wasn't can check the session record. There's nothing to "send out" — the system is the record.

## Meeting anti-patterns

| Anti-pattern | What to do instead |
|---|---|
| No agenda — "let's see what comes up" | Decision sponsors route their decisions to the session beforehand |
| Too many items — rushing through 10 decisions | Limit to 3-5 decisions; the rest age and create pressure for next time |
| Discussion without resolution | The facilitator forces a Taken outcome or explicitly rolls it |
| Decisions taken without commitments | Create commitments in the session, with owners in the room |
| Notes but no objects | Capture outcomes as decisions and commitments, not just meeting notes |
| Post-meeting email summarizing what happened | The session detail page is the summary — point people there |
