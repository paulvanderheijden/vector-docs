description: "A complete guide to running your company on Vector."

This playbook describes, step by step, how a leadership team uses Vector to run their company. It covers the full operating rhythm — from setting strategy down to following up on individual commitments.

Vector is not a project management tool bolted onto meetings. It's an operating system that connects **strategy → execution → accountability** in a single loop.

## The operating loop

```
Strategy → Initiatives & Projects → Monitoring → Decisions → Commitments → Review → (repeat)
```

Every activity in Vector feeds into this loop:

1. **You set strategy** by defining initiatives and projects
2. **You monitor execution** by tracking project health and surfacing problems
3. **You intervene** by raising decisions when things need direction
4. **You execute** by creating commitments with clear owners and due dates
5. **You review** in sessions, where stalled commitments and aging decisions become visible
6. **You adjust** — and the loop repeats

  </Step>
  <Step title="Raise and resolve decisions">
    Anyone can surface an issue. Decisions are routed to the right circle, owned by one person, and resolved in sessions.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Run your meetings">
    Prepare the agenda, run the session with Vector open, and capture outcomes as decisions and commitments — not meeting notes.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Track commitments">
    Every commitment has an owner, a due date, and a review circle. Follow up happens automatically through the session rhythm.
