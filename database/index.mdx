Vector uses **PostgreSQL** hosted on **Railway** as its primary data store. The schema is managed entirely through Django's migration framework — all table definitions, constraints, and indexes are version-controlled and reversible.

## Architecture

```
Django REST API (Railway) → PostgreSQL (Railway)
```

Django models define the schema. Migrations are generated with `python manage.py makemigrations` and applied with `python manage.py migrate`.

## Key conventions

| Convention | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Primary keys** | Auto-increment integers (`BigAutoField`, Django default) |
| **Soft deletes** | Workspace members are never hard-deleted — `is_active = False` instead |
| **Workspace scoping** | All domain tables include a `workspace_id` foreign key via `WorkspaceScopedModel` |
| **Naming** | Snake-case table and column names (Django default) |
