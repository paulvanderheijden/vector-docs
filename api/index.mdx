The Vector API is a RESTful JSON API. Authentication is at the user level via JWT tokens. Workspace-scoped resources are nested under a workspace path.

## Base URL

```
https://api.vectorapp.io/v1
```

## Authentication

Vector uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with an access + refresh token pattern.

### Obtaining tokens

```
POST /v1/auth/token

Request:  { "email": "matt@mews.com", "password": "..." }
Response: { "access": "eyJ...", "refresh": "eyJ...", "user": {...}, "workspaces": [...] }
```

The login response includes the user profile and their workspace list — no second call needed.

### Using tokens

All requests require a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <access-token>
```

Tokens are scoped to a **person**, not a workspace. A single token can access any workspace the person belongs to.

### Token lifecycle

| Token | Lifetime | Storage |
|---|---|---|
| Access token | 30 minutes | `localStorage` |
| Refresh token | 7 days | `localStorage` |

When the access token expires, use the refresh endpoint to get a new one. On logout, the refresh token is blacklisted server-side.

See the [Authentication endpoints](/api/auth) for full details.

## Workspace scoping

Most resources belong to a workspace. These endpoints are nested under the workspace slug:

```
/v1/workspaces/{workspaceSlug}/circles
/v1/workspaces/{workspaceSlug}/decisions
/v1/workspaces/{workspaceSlug}/commitments
...
```

The server verifies that the authenticated person is a member of the workspace on every request. If not, the request returns `404`.

Top-level endpoints that are **not** workspace-scoped:
- `/v1/auth/*` — authentication
- `/v1/workspaces` — list workspaces the person belongs to
- `/v1/me` — current user profile

## Common patterns

### IDs

All entities have a unique `id` field (UUID). IDs are assigned by the server on creation.

### Timestamps

All entities include `createdAt` and `updatedAt` timestamps in ISO 8601 format.

### Pagination

List endpoints return paginated results:

```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "hasMore": true,
  "nextCursor": "abc123"
}
```

Pass `cursor` as a query parameter to fetch the next page. Default page size is 50, max is 200.

### Filtering

List endpoints support filtering via query parameters. Common filters:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `status` | Filter by status value |
| `circleId` | Filter by circle |
| `initiativeId` | Filter by initiative |
| `projectId` | Filter by project |
| `ownerPersonId` | Filter by owner |
| `sponsorPersonId` | Filter by sponsor |

### Errors

Errors follow a consistent format:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "not_found",
    "message": "Decision not found"
  }
}
```

| HTTP Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `400` | Bad request — invalid parameters |
| `401` | Unauthorized — missing or invalid token |
| `403` | Forbidden — insufficient permissions (e.g., Member trying Admin action) |
| `404` | Not found — or no access to the workspace |
| `422` | Unprocessable — validation failed |
| `429` | Rate limited |
| `500` | Internal server error |
