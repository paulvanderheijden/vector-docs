A **session** is a record that a circle actually met. It captures what was discussed, which decisions were on the agenda, which commitments were reviewed, and any notes from the meeting.

Sessions are created by the **circle chair**. Only circle members can view sessions in their circle.

Sessions are the heartbeat of a circle. Regular sessions with covered agendas signal a healthy circle. Skipped sessions and empty agendas signal decay.

## Anatomy of a session

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Number** | Auto-generated sequential identifier within the circle (e.g., Session 11). Each circle has its own independent numbering starting at 1. |
| **Title** | Editable session title, defaults to the circle name |
| **Date** | When the session occurred (or is scheduled) |
| **Decisions** | The decisions on the agenda for this session |
| **Commitments** | The commitments reviewed in this session |
| **Notes** | Free-form meeting notes in markdown |
| **Status** | `Open` (upcoming or in progress), `Closed` (completed), or `Cancelled`. When Closed or Cancelled, all fields are locked except the status itself. Only the circle chair can close, cancel, or reopen a session. |

## Session detail page

The session detail page is the primary workspace during a meeting. It shows:

1. **Decisions** — a reorderable list of decisions on the agenda. Each row shows the decision title, status badge, and sponsor. The circle chair can add, remove, and reorder decisions.

2. **Commitments** — a list of commitments being reviewed. Each row shows the commitment title, linked decision reference, and owner. The circle chair can add and remove commitments.

3. **Meeting notes** — a rich text editor for capturing discussion, context, and action items. Any circle member can edit meeting notes while the session is Open.

## Upcoming vs. previous

Sessions are naturally split into two categories:

- **Upcoming** — sessions scheduled for a future date. These are where you prepare the agenda.
- **Previous** — sessions that have already occurred. These are the record of what happened.

## Sessions and circle health

The pattern of sessions tells a story:

- Regular sessions on cadence = healthy circle
- Gaps in sessions = the circle is being neglected
- Sessions with empty agendas = the circle may not be necessary
- Sessions with many rolled commitments = execution problems
