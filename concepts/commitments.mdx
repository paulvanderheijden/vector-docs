A **commitment** is the second atomic unit in Vector. Where decisions set direction, commitments drive execution. A commitment answers: **who will do what by when?**

Commitments are reviewed in forum sessions. They have a single owner, a due date, and a status that makes delivery (or slippage) visible.

## Anatomy of a commitment

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Title** | What will be delivered, written as a concrete outcome |
| **Description** | Additional context or acceptance criteria in markdown |
| **Owner** | The single person accountable for delivery |
| **Review forum** | The circle where this commitment is reviewed |
| **Due** | When it's expected to be delivered |
| **Status** | Current state: Active, At risk, Rolled, Delivered |
| **Decision** | The decision this commitment flows from (optional) |

## Status values

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Active** | On track, being worked on |
| **At risk** | The owner or reviewer has flagged potential slippage |
| **Rolled** | The due date was missed and the commitment carried over to the next review cycle |
| **Delivered** | The outcome has been completed |

## Relationship to decisions

Commitments often flow from decisions — when a decision is taken, the forum creates commitments to execute on it. A single decision can produce multiple commitments with different owners.

However, commitments can also be **standalone**. Not every commitment needs a parent decision. A forum can create a commitment directly (e.g., "Prepare the board deck by Friday").

## The "roll" mechanic

When a commitment's due date passes without delivery, its status changes to **Rolled**. This is the system punishing neglect — the commitment doesn't disappear or get quietly extended. It visibly carries over to the next session with its rolled status on display.

Rolled commitments create natural accountability pressure in the forum review.

## Review in sessions

Commitments are reviewed during [sessions](/concepts/sessions). Each session has a list of commitments on its agenda. During the session, the forum checks:

- Is it still active and on track?
- Should it be flagged as at risk?
- Has it been delivered?
- Has it rolled from a previous session?
