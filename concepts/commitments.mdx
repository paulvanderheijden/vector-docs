A **commitment** is the second atomic unit in Vector. Where decisions set direction, commitments drive execution. A commitment answers: **who will do what by when?**

Any **circle member** can create a commitment during an open session. **Circle chairs** can also create standalone commitments outside of a session. The owner must be a member of the commitment's circle.

Commitments are reviewed in circle sessions. They have a single owner, a due date, and a status that makes delivery (or slippage) visible.

## Anatomy of a commitment

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Title** | What will be delivered, written as a concrete outcome |
| **Description** | Additional context or acceptance criteria in markdown |
| **Owner** | The single person accountable for delivery |
| **Review circle** | The circle where this commitment is reviewed |
| **Due** | When it's expected to be delivered |
| **Status** | Current state: Active, Rolled, Delivered |
| **Decision** | The decision this commitment flows from (optional) |

## Status values

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Active** | On track, being worked on |
| **Rolled** | The due date was missed and the commitment carried over to the next review cycle |
| **Delivered** | The outcome has been completed |

## Relationship to decisions

Commitments often flow from decisions — when a decision is taken, circle members create commitments to execute on it. A single decision can produce multiple commitments with different owners. If a commitment is linked to a decision, it must belong to the same circle.

However, commitments can also be **standalone**. Not every commitment needs a parent decision. A circle chair can create a commitment directly (e.g., "Prepare the board deck by Friday").

## The "roll" mechanic

When a commitment's due date passes without delivery, its status changes to **Rolled**. This is the system punishing neglect — the commitment doesn't disappear or get quietly extended. It visibly carries over to the next session with its rolled status on display.

Rolled commitments create natural accountability pressure in the circle review.

## Editing commitments

The commitment outcome and description can be edited by the **owner** or **circle chair**. Only the circle chair can reassign ownership, roll commitments, or delete them.

## Review in sessions

Commitments are reviewed during [sessions](/concepts/sessions). Each session has a list of commitments on its agenda. During the session, the circle checks:

- Is it still active and on track?
- Has it been delivered? The owner or circle chair marks it Delivered.
- Has it rolled from a previous session? The circle chair addresses it.
