**Initiatives** and **projects** provide the strategic context layer in Vector. They answer "what are we working on and why?" — while decisions and commitments answer "what did we decide?" and "who's doing what?"

## Initiatives

An initiative is a strategic bet — a high-level objective the organization is pursuing.

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Name** | The initiative's title |
| **Status** | Planned, Active, or Completed |
| **Target date** | Flexible granularity: month, quarter, or year |
| **Circles** | Circles linked to this initiative (for restricted visibility) |

Initiatives contain one or more projects. They represent the "why" — the strategic direction.

**Examples:**
- "Launch DACH market by end of Q1"
- "Ship enterprise tier (SSO + analytics)"
- "Reduce churn from 8% to 5%"

## Projects

A project is an execution container that belongs to exactly one initiative. It represents a concrete stream of work.

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Name** | The project's title |
| **Initiative** | The parent initiative (required, exactly one) |
| **Lead** | The person responsible for the project |
| **Circles** | Circles linked to this project (for restricted visibility) |

Projects can have **updates** — status reports posted by the project lead that track progress over time.

### Project updates

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Date** | When the update was posted |
| **Author** | The person who wrote the update (typically the project lead) |
| **Health** | On track, At risk, or Off track |
| **Content** | The update body in markdown |

## Linking to decisions and commitments

Decisions and commitments can optionally reference an initiative or project for context. This linkage is informational — it helps people understand **why** a decision matters or **what strategic bet** a commitment serves.

For example:
- Decision: "Prioritize DACH launch over Nordics expansion" → linked to the DACH initiative
- Commitment: "DACH go-live with 3 pilot customers by end of Q1" → linked to the DACH initiative

## Visibility

By default, initiatives and projects are **visible to all workspace members**. To restrict access, link one or more circles to the initiative or project — only members of those circles will be able to see it.

- **No linked circles** → visible to all workspace members (public)
- **Has linked circles** → visible only to members of the linked circles (restricted)

Project visibility is independent of its parent initiative. A public initiative can contain restricted projects, and vice versa.
