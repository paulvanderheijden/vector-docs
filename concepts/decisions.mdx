title: "Decisions"
description: "Direction-setting artifacts that flow through circles until they're taken."
---

A **decision** is the primary atomic unit in Vector. It represents a direction-setting choice that needs to be made by a leadership team.

Any **workspace member** can create a decision — they become the requestor and can route it to any circle, even one they're not a member of. The draft is visible only to the requestor in My Items until it's formally submitted to the circle.

Every decision has a clear title, a circle where it's routed, and an age counter that starts ticking the moment it's formally requested. The longer a decision sits unresolved, the more visible the pressure becomes.

## Anatomy of a decision

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Title** | What needs to be decided, written as a clear, actionable sentence |
| **Description** | Background context, options, and rationale in markdown |
| **Circle** | The circle where this decision is routed for discussion |
| **Status** | Where the decision is in its lifecycle (Draft, Requested, Scheduled, Rolled, Taken) |
| **Age** | Days since the decision was formally requested (status moved to Requested) |
| **Requested by** | The person who raised the need for this decision (set at creation) |
| **Requested date** | Auto-set when the decision moves from Draft to Requested |
| **Sponsor** | The circle member who prepares and drives this decision in a session (set when Scheduled) |
| **Owner** | The person accountable for the decision after it's taken — tracks validity, can revoke (set when Taken) |
| **References** | Files or links attached for context |
| **Initiative / Project** | Context linkage to an initiative or project (optional) |

## Status values

<Steps>
  <Step title="Draft">
    The decision has been created but isn't ready for circle discussion yet. The requestor is framing the problem and gathering initial context. Drafts are visible only to the requestor in My Items — they do not appear in circle views.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Requested">
    The decision is formally submitted to a circle. The age counter starts ticking. It's available for an upcoming session.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Scheduled">
    The decision has been placed on a specific session's agenda. A sponsor is assigned — the circle member who will prepare and drive it in the session.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Rolled">
    The decision was on the agenda but wasn't resolved in the session. It rolls to the next session — the age counter keeps ticking.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Taken">
    The circle has made the call. The circle chair assigns an owner — the person accountable for the decision going forward. The decision is closed and commitments may be created from it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Superseded">
    A previous decision has been replaced by a revisit decision. The original is marked Superseded and linked to the new decision.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## The three roles

Decisions involve three distinct roles, each set at a different point in the lifecycle.

### Requestor (set at creation)

The person who raised the need. They create pull ("we need a decision on X because Y is blocked"). Every decision has a requestor — the system always tracks who surfaced the issue. The requestor is informed when the decision is taken.

### Sponsor (assigned by the circle chair when Scheduled)

The circle member responsible for getting the decision **prepared and resolved** in a session. They ensure it's framed, has the right context, and is driven to a resolution. The sponsor must be a member of the decision's circle.

<Note>
  The sponsor owns the act of deciding, not the lifetime of the decision. Once taken, their job is done.
</Note>

### Owner (assigned by the circle chair when Taken)

The person broadly accountable for the decision after it's taken. They track whether the decision holds up over time and are authorized to revoke it if needed. If reality changes, the owner can raise a revisit decision. The owner must be a member of the decision's circle.

<Note>
  The owner is not the same as the commitment owners who execute on the decision. The owner watches over the decision itself — was it the right call?
</Note>

## Age and pressure

Every decision has an age counter (in days) that starts when it moves to **Requested** status. While in Draft, there is no age — the decision hasn't been formally submitted yet.

Vector uses color coding to make aging visible:

- **Green** — fresh, within expected timeframe
- **Amber** — aging, needs attention
- **Red** — overdue, likely stalled

There are no reminders or notifications. The age is always visible wherever the decision appears — in tables, dashboards, and session agendas.

## Linking decisions

Decisions can optionally be linked to:

- An **initiative** or **project** for strategic context
- A **previous decision** via the revisit chain (when revisiting an earlier call)
- One or more **commitments** that flow from the decision once taken
