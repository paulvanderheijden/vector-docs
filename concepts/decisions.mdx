A **decision** is the primary atomic unit in Vector. It represents a direction-setting choice that needs to be made by a leadership team.

Every decision has a clear title, a sponsor within the circle, and a forum where it's routed. Decisions age over time — the longer they sit unresolved, the more visible the pressure becomes.

## Anatomy of a decision

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Title** | What needs to be decided, written as a clear, actionable sentence |
| **Description** | Background context, options, and rationale in markdown |
| **Sponsor** | The circle member responsible for preparing and driving this decision to resolution |
| **Owner** | The person broadly accountable for the decision area (optional) |
| **Forum** | The circle where this decision is routed for discussion |
| **Status** | Where the decision is in its lifecycle (Draft, Proposed, Scheduled, Rolled, Taken) |
| **Age** | Days since creation — increases pressure visually |
| **Requested by** | The person who raised the need for this decision |
| **Requested date** | When the decision was requested |
| **References** | Files or links attached for context |
| **Initiative / Project** | Context linkage to an initiative or project (optional) |

## Status values

<Steps>
  <Step title="Draft">
    The decision has been created but isn't ready for forum discussion yet. The sponsor is still framing the problem, gathering context, or preparing options.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Proposed">
    The decision is ready and has been routed to a forum. It's available for an upcoming session.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Scheduled">
    The decision has been placed on a specific session's agenda. The sponsor has confirmed it's ready for discussion.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Rolled">
    The decision was on the agenda but wasn't resolved in the session. It rolls to the next session — the age counter keeps ticking.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Taken">
    The forum has made the call. The decision is closed and commitments may be created from it.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## The three roles

Decisions involve three distinct roles. Keeping them separate is critical to how Vector works.

### Requestor

The person who raised the need. They create pull ("we need a decision on X because Y is blocked"), but they don't own the decision. Every decision has a requestor — the system always tracks who surfaced the issue.

### Sponsor

The circle member responsible for getting the decision **prepared and resolved**. They ensure it's framed, has the right context, and is driven to a resolution in a session. They are the person who should feel uncomfortable if it stalls.

<Note>
  The sponsor owns the act of deciding, not the lifetime of the decision. Once taken, their job is done.
</Note>

### Outcome accountable

Handled via [commitments](/concepts/commitments), not decision sponsorship. Once a decision is taken, commitments are created and commitment owners execute and monitor.

## Age and pressure

Every decision has an age counter (in days) that starts at creation. Vector uses color coding to make aging visible:

- **Green** — fresh, within expected timeframe
- **Amber** — aging, needs attention
- **Red** — overdue, likely stalled

There are no reminders or notifications. The age is always visible wherever the decision appears — in tables, dashboards, and session agendas.

## Linking decisions

Decisions can optionally be linked to:

- An **initiative** or **project** for strategic context
- A **previous decision** via the revisit chain (when revisiting an earlier call)
- One or more **commitments** that flow from the decision once taken
