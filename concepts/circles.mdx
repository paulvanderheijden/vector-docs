A **circle** is a recurring forum — a group of people who meet at a regular cadence to make decisions and review commitments. In Vector, circles are the routing layer for the entire system.

Decisions don't float in space. They're routed to a specific circle where the right people can discuss and resolve them.

## Anatomy of a circle

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Name** | The circle's name (e.g., "MT Weekly", "Product Forum") |
| **Cadence** | How often the circle meets: Weekly, Biweekly, or Manual |
| **Session day** | The day of the week the circle meets (for Weekly and Biweekly cadences) |
| **Members** | The people who are part of this circle. Each member has a role: **Member** or **Organizer**. Organizers are responsible for preparing sessions — setting the agenda, ensuring decisions are ready, and reviewing commitments before the meeting. |

## Circles as the routing layer

When someone creates a decision, they route it to a circle. This means:

- The decision appears on that circle's agenda
- The circle's members will discuss it in an upcoming session
- The circle can take the decision or roll it to the next session

A decision lives in exactly one circle at a time.

## Circle health

Circles degrade when neglected. The system tracks:

- **Session regularity** — is the circle meeting on cadence?
- **Agenda coverage** — are decisions and commitments actually being reviewed?
- **Decision throughput** — are decisions aging or moving?

This isn't a score or a dashboard widget. It's built into the texture of how the circle feels when you open it — stale circles look stale.
