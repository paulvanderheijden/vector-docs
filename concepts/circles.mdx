A **circle** is a recurring forum — a group of people who meet at a regular cadence to make decisions and review commitments. In Vector, circles are the routing layer for the entire system.

Decisions don't float in space. They're routed to a specific circle where the right people can discuss and resolve them.

## Anatomy of a circle

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Name** | The forum's name (e.g., "MT Weekly", "Product Forum") |
| **Purpose** | Either **Decide** (the forum makes decisions) or **Review** (the forum reviews progress) |
| **Cadence** | How often the circle meets (e.g., "Weekly (Mon)", "Biweekly", "Monthly") |
| **Members** | The people who are part of this circle |

## Purpose: Decide vs. Review

Circles have one of two purposes:

### Decide

The circle exists primarily to **make decisions**. Sessions are structured around an agenda of decisions to discuss, debate, and resolve. Commitments are created as outputs of those decisions.

Examples: MT Weekly, GTM Council, Product Forum.

### Review

The circle exists primarily to **review progress**. Sessions are structured around reviewing commitment status, initiative health, and flagging issues. Decisions may still be made, but the primary activity is accountability review.

Examples: People & Org Review, Quarterly Business Review.

## Circles as the routing layer

When someone creates a decision, they route it to a circle. This means:

- The decision appears on that circle's agenda
- The circle's members will discuss it in an upcoming session
- The circle can take, escalate, or delegate the decision

A decision lives in exactly one circle at a time. If it's escalated, it moves to a different circle. If it's delegated, it moves down.

## Circle health

Circles degrade when neglected. The system tracks:

- **Session regularity** — is the circle meeting on cadence?
- **Agenda coverage** — are decisions and commitments actually being reviewed?
- **Decision throughput** — are decisions aging or moving?

This isn't a score or a dashboard widget. It's built into the texture of how the circle feels when you open it — stale circles look stale.
