## Screen details

### Inbox

The landing page. Shows all decisions with status "Requested" from circles the current user belongs to in the active workspace. Circle filter tabs at the top allow narrowing to a specific circle. Empty state when no proposed decisions exist.

### My Items

Personal view of the user's assigned work in the active workspace. Two tabs:

- **Decisions** — all decisions where the user is the owner, sponsor, or requestor. This is the only place Draft decisions appear (they are excluded from circle views).
- **Commitments** — all commitments where the user is the owner

Tab counts shown in the tab labels.

### Circles List

Table of all circles. Columns: circle name, membership status (Joined badge or Join button), purpose badge, cadence, and stacked member avatars (max 6 shown with +N overflow). Clicking a row navigates to that circle's decisions.

### Circle Decisions

The primary decision workspace for a circle. Shows all non-Draft decisions belonging to this circle with filter tabs to narrow the view. Draft decisions are private to the requestor and only appear on My Items.

- **Decision filter tabs** — "Open" (Requested, Scheduled) / "Closed" (Taken)
- **Session links** — each decision shows its linked session number and date as a clickable badge
- **Columns** — ref, statement, session, owner (PersonField avatar), status (StatusField), age
- **[New Decision] button** in header
- Each decision links to its full detail view

### Circle Commitments

The commitment tracking view for a circle. Shows all commitments belonging to this circle.

- **Columns** — ref, outcome, decision ref, owner (PersonField avatar), due date, status (StatusField)
- No filter tabs (yet) — shows all commitments
- Each commitment links to its review view

### Decision Detail

Single-page view for a single decision. No tabs, no sidebar — all content on one scrollable page with inline properties. All editable fields persist to the backend via PATCH on change (markdown fields are debounced).

**Content (top to bottom):**
1. **TextField** — editable decision statement (saves on blur)
2. **PropertiesRow** (inline) — status (editable StatusField, saves on select), submitted date (DateField with date + age), requested by (PersonField, read-only), circle (CircleField), sponsor (nullable PersonField, saves on select), owner (nullable PersonField, saves on select)
3. **Description** — MarkdownEditor (debounced save)
4. **Discussion and outcome** — MarkdownEditor (debounced save)
5. **Summary for requestor** — MarkdownEditor (debounced save)
6. **Commitments** — EntityList showing linked commitments with status + owner
7. **Activity** — ChangeLog feed

### Commitment Detail

Single-page view for a single commitment. No tabs, no sidebar — inline properties. Fields are only editable when accessed from a session with status "Open". All editable fields persist to the backend via PATCH on change.

**Content (top to bottom):**
1. **Alert banner** — rolled (red) or at-risk (amber) status warning
2. **TextField** — editable commitment outcome (saves on blur, editable only when session is Open)
3. **PropertiesRow** (inline) — status (StatusField, saves on select), due date (DateField with calendar picker, saves on select), owner (PersonField, saves on select), circle (CircleField)
4. **Description** — MarkdownEditor (debounced save, editable only when session is Open)
5. **Linked Decision** — card with decision ref, statement, status, and circle
6. **Activity** — ChangeLog feed

Header includes a "Re-commit?" button when status is Rolled or At risk.

### Sessions List

Paginated list of sessions for a circle. Three URL variants render the same component with different data:

- `/circles/:slug/sessions` — all sessions, newest first
- `/circles/:slug/sessions/upcoming` — future sessions only
- `/circles/:slug/sessions/previous` — past sessions only

Table columns: session number, title (with badge), date, decision count, commitment count, completed check. 10 sessions per page with Previous/Next pagination.

Exactly one session per circle can carry each badge:

- **Previous** (green badge) — the last session with status "Closed"
- **Current** (amber badge) — today's session, or the most recent past session that is still "Open" (i.e. a missed session). Only appears when one exists.
- **Upcoming** (blue badge) — the next session strictly in the future

### Session Detail

Meeting workspace designed to be open during a session. All editable fields persist to the backend via PATCH on change (notes are debounced):

- **Editable title** — TextField styled as heading (saves on blur)
- **Properties row** — session date (DateField with calendar picker, saves on select), status (Open/Closed/Cancelled via StatusField, saves on select), chair (PersonField, saves on select)
- **Decisions section** — reorderable table (drag-and-drop, saves new order immediately), compact mode with combined status+owner column. Clicking a decision opens a 480px drawer on the right with description, discussion, and summary
- **Commitments section** — compact table with combined decision ref + owner column
- **Meeting notes** — TipTap markdown editor (debounced save)
- **Activity** — ChangeLog feed
- **Closed/Cancelled lock** — when status is "Closed" or "Cancelled", a full-width `Banner` appears below the header and all fields (title, date, chair, notes) become read-only. "Add Decision" / "Add Commitment" buttons and decision drawer are disabled. The status field stays editable so the user can re-open the session. Closed shows `<Banner variant="warning" icon={Lock}>`; Cancelled shows `<Banner variant="muted">`.

### Initiatives List

Filterable list of initiatives for the active workspace. Status tabs (Active / Planned / Completed) at the top. Filter popover for health and owner. Table columns: icon, title, owner (PersonField avatar), target quarter, projects progress (completed/total), health indicator.

### Initiative Detail

Strategic initiative overview. All editable fields persist to the backend via PATCH on change (description is debounced). Three tabs:

- **Overview** — clickable icon with picker popover (8 icon/color combos, saves on select), editable title and summary (TextField, saves on blur), inline properties (status via StatusField saves on select, health via HealthField, owner via PersonField saves on select, target via TargetDateField saves on select), description (MarkdownEditor, debounced save)
- **Updates** — placeholder (coming soon)
- **Projects** — table of linked projects with owner, health, decision/commitment counts

Right sidebar mirrors properties (both sidebar and main content fields trigger the same save).

### Projects List

Projects for the active workspace, grouped by parent initiative. Group rows show initiative title, project count, and expand/collapse toggle. Filter popover for health. Scope tabs: All Projects / My Projects. Table columns: title, owner (PersonField avatar), health, active decision count, open commitment count.

### Project Detail

Execution detail for a project. Single scrollable page with decisions and commitments sections. Right sidebar toggle. All editable fields persist to the backend via PATCH on change.

- **Alert banner** — if >2 rolled commitments

- **Inline properties** — HealthField, owner (PersonField, saves on select), parent initiative (InitiativeField)
- **Decisions** — EntityList with ref, title, circle name, and status
