## Screen details

### Inbox

The landing page. Shows all decisions with status "Proposed" from circles the current user belongs to. Circle filter tabs at the top allow narrowing to a specific circle. Empty state when no proposed decisions exist.

### My Items

Personal view of the user's assigned work. Two tabs:

- **Decisions** — all decisions where the user is the owner, sponsor, or requestor. This is the only place Draft decisions appear (they are excluded from circle views).
- **Commitments** — all commitments where the user is the owner

Tab counts shown in the tab labels.

### Strategy

Full-width editable strategy document using the TipTap markdown editor. A sticky table of contents sidebar (desktop only) is auto-generated from H2/H3/H4 headings in the editor via a MutationObserver, with scroll-spy highlighting.

### Circles List

Table of all circles. Columns: circle name, membership status (Joined badge or Join button), purpose badge, cadence, and stacked member avatars (max 6 shown with +N overflow). Clicking a row navigates to that circle's decisions.

### Circle Decisions

The primary decision workspace for a circle. Shows all non-Draft decisions belonging to this circle with filter tabs to narrow the view. Draft decisions are private to the requestor and only appear on My Items.

- **Decision filter tabs** — "Open" (Requested, Scheduled) / "Closed" (Taken)
- **Session links** — each decision shows its linked session number and date as a clickable badge
- **Columns** — ref, statement, session, owner (PersonField avatar), status (StatusField), age
- **[New Decision] button** in header
- Each decision links to its full detail view

### Circle Commitments

The commitment tracking view for a circle. Shows all commitments belonging to this circle.

- **Columns** — ref, outcome, decision ref, owner (PersonField avatar), due date, status (StatusField)
- No filter tabs (yet) — shows all commitments
- Each commitment links to its review view

### Decision Detail

Single-page view for a single decision with an always-open right sidebar (288px). No tabs — all content on one scrollable page.

**Main content (top to bottom):**
1. **TextField** — editable decision statement
2. **Rationale** — MarkdownEditor for the decision rationale
3. **Discussion** — MarkdownEditor for session discussion notes
4. **Summary** — read-only text showing the decision statement
5. **Notify requestor** — checkbox to share the summary with the requestor (persistent field)
6. **Commitments** — CommitmentsTable showing linked commitments
7. **Activity** — ChangeLog feed

**Always-open sidebar:**
- Status (editable StatusField)
- Requested by (read-only PersonField with name, title="Requested by")
- Age (color-coded)
- Circle (link)
- Sponsor (nullable PersonField — shows "Add Sponsor" placeholder when unset, editable with "No Sponsor" clear option)
- Owner (nullable PersonField — shows "Add Owner" placeholder when unset, editable with "No Owner" clear option)

### Commitment Review

Detail view for a single commitment. Two tabs:

- **Overview** — alert banner for rolled/at-risk status, editable outcome (TextField), properties row (StatusField, due date, owner, circle), linked decision card
- **Activity** — changelog feed

Right sidebar mirrors properties. Header includes a "Re-commit?" button when status is Rolled or At risk.

### Sessions List

Paginated list of sessions for a circle. Three URL variants render the same component with different data:

- `/circles/:slug/sessions` — all sessions, newest first
- `/circles/:slug/sessions/upcoming` — future sessions only
- `/circles/:slug/sessions/previous` — past sessions only

Table columns: session number, title (with badge), date, decision count, commitment count, completed check. 10 sessions per page with Previous/Next pagination.

Exactly one session per circle can carry each badge:

- **Previous** (green badge) — the last session in the past with `completed=true`
- **Current** (amber badge) — today's session, or the most recent past session with `completed=false` (i.e. a missed session). Only appears when one exists.
- **Upcoming** (blue badge) — the next session strictly in the future

A session cannot be marked as completed when its date is in the future.

### Session Detail

Meeting workspace designed to be open during a session:

- **Editable title** — TextField styled as heading
- **Properties row** — session date (DateField), status (Open/Closed/Cancelled via StatusField), chair (PersonField)
- **Decisions section** — reorderable table (drag-and-drop), compact mode with combined status+owner column. Clicking a decision opens a 480px drawer on the right with rationale, implications, and discussion
- **Commitments section** — compact table with combined decision ref + owner column
- **Meeting notes** — TipTap markdown editor
- **Closed/Cancelled lock** — when status is "Closed" or "Cancelled", a full-width `ReadOnlyBanner` appears below the header and all fields (title, date, chair, notes) become read-only. "Add Decision" / "Add Commitment" buttons and decision drawer are disabled. The status field stays editable so the user can re-open the session. Closed shows an amber banner; Cancelled shows a gray banner.

### Initiatives List

Filterable list of initiatives. Status tabs (Active / Planned / Completed) at the top. Filter popover for health and owner. Table columns: icon, title, owner (PersonSelector avatar), target quarter, projects progress (completed/total), health indicator.

### Initiative Detail

Strategic initiative overview. Three tabs:

- **Overview** — clickable icon with picker popover (8 icon/color combos), editable title and summary (TextField), inline properties (status via StatusField, health/target via PropertySelect, owner via PersonField), description (MarkdownEditor)
- **Updates** — placeholder (coming soon)
- **Projects** — table of linked projects with owner, health, teams, decision/commitment counts

Right sidebar mirrors properties.

### Projects List

Projects grouped by parent initiative. Group rows show initiative title, project count, and expand/collapse toggle. Filter popover for team and health. Scope tabs: All Projects / My Projects. Table columns: title (with lock icon for private), owner (PersonSelector avatar), health, teams (TeamChips), active decision count, open commitment count.

### Project Detail

Execution detail for a project. Three tabs:

- **Overview** — alert banner if >2 rolled commitments, editable title and description (TextField), inline properties (health, visibility, owner via PropertySelect, parent initiative link), teams (TeamChips)
- **Decisions** — lightweight decision list (DecisionList)
- **Commitments** — lightweight commitment list (CommitmentList)

Right sidebar has: Properties, Signals (open commitments, rolled count, recent decisions), Teams, and People (private projects only — owner, subscribers, invite selector).

Follow/Unfollow button in header for public projects where user is not the owner.
