## Screen details

### Inbox

The landing page. Shows all decisions with status "Requested" from circles the current user belongs to in the active workspace. Circle filter tabs at the top allow narrowing to a specific circle. Empty state when no proposed decisions exist.

### My Items

Personal view of the user's assigned work in the active workspace. Two tabs:

- **Decisions** — all decisions where the user is the owner, sponsor, or requestor. This is the only place Draft decisions appear (they are excluded from circle views).
- **Commitments** — all commitments where the user is the owner

Tab counts shown in the tab labels.

### Strategy

Full-width editable strategy document using the TipTap markdown editor, scoped to the active workspace. A sticky table of contents sidebar (desktop only) is auto-generated from H2/H3/H4 headings in the editor via a MutationObserver, with scroll-spy highlighting.

### Circles List

Table of all circles. Columns: circle name, membership status (Joined badge or Join button), purpose badge, cadence, and stacked member avatars (max 6 shown with +N overflow). Clicking a row navigates to that circle's decisions.

### Circle Decisions

The primary decision workspace for a circle. Shows all non-Draft decisions belonging to this circle with filter tabs to narrow the view. Draft decisions are private to the requestor and only appear on My Items.

- **Decision filter tabs** — "Open" (Requested, Scheduled) / "Closed" (Taken)
- **Session links** — each decision shows its linked session number and date as a clickable badge
- **Columns** — ref, statement, session, owner (PersonField avatar), status (StatusField), age
- **[New Decision] button** in header
- Each decision links to its full detail view

### Circle Commitments

The commitment tracking view for a circle. Shows all commitments belonging to this circle.

- **Columns** — ref, outcome, decision ref, owner (PersonField avatar), due date, status (StatusField)
- No filter tabs (yet) — shows all commitments
- Each commitment links to its review view

### Decision Detail

Single-page view for a single decision. No tabs, no sidebar — all content on one scrollable page with inline properties.

**Content (top to bottom):**
1. **TextField** — editable decision statement
2. **PropertiesRow** (inline) — status (editable StatusField), submitted date (DateField with date + age), requested by (PersonField), circle (CircleField), sponsor (nullable PersonField), owner (nullable PersonField)
3. **Description** — MarkdownEditor
4. **Discussion and outcome** — MarkdownEditor
5. **Summary for requestor** — MarkdownEditor
6. **Commitments** — EntityList showing linked commitments with status + owner
7. **Activity** — ChangeLog feed

### Commitment Detail

Single-page view for a single commitment. No tabs, no sidebar — inline properties.

**Content (top to bottom):**
1. **Alert banner** — rolled (red) or at-risk (amber) status warning
2. **TextField** — editable commitment outcome
3. **PropertiesRow** (inline) — status (StatusField), due date (DateField), owner (PersonField), circle (CircleField)
4. **Linked Decision** — card with decision ref, statement, status, and circle
5. **Activity** — ChangeLog feed

Header includes a "Re-commit?" button when status is Rolled or At risk.

### Sessions List

Paginated list of sessions for a circle. Three URL variants render the same component with different data:

- `/circles/:slug/sessions` — all sessions, newest first
- `/circles/:slug/sessions/upcoming` — future sessions only
- `/circles/:slug/sessions/previous` — past sessions only

Table columns: session number, title (with badge), date, decision count, commitment count, completed check. 10 sessions per page with Previous/Next pagination.

Exactly one session per circle can carry each badge:

- **Previous** (green badge) — the last session with status "Closed"
- **Current** (amber badge) — today's session, or the most recent past session that is still "Open" (i.e. a missed session). Only appears when one exists.
- **Upcoming** (blue badge) — the next session strictly in the future

### Session Detail

Meeting workspace designed to be open during a session:

- **Editable title** — TextField styled as heading
- **Properties row** — session date (DateField with calendar picker), status (Open/Closed/Cancelled via StatusField), chair (PersonField)
- **Decisions section** — reorderable table (drag-and-drop), compact mode with combined status+owner column. Clicking a decision opens a 480px drawer on the right with description, discussion, and summary
- **Commitments section** — compact table with combined decision ref + owner column
- **Meeting notes** — TipTap markdown editor
- **Activity** — ChangeLog feed
- **Closed/Cancelled lock** — when status is "Closed" or "Cancelled", a full-width `Banner` appears below the header and all fields (title, date, chair, notes) become read-only. "Add Decision" / "Add Commitment" buttons and decision drawer are disabled. The status field stays editable so the user can re-open the session. Closed shows `<Banner variant="warning" icon={Lock}>`; Cancelled shows `<Banner variant="muted">`.

### Initiatives List

Filterable list of initiatives for the active workspace. Status tabs (Active / Planned / Completed) at the top. Filter popover for health and owner. Table columns: icon, title, owner (PersonSelector avatar), target quarter, projects progress (completed/total), health indicator.

### Initiative Detail

Strategic initiative overview. Three tabs:

- **Overview** — clickable icon with picker popover (8 icon/color combos), editable title and summary (TextField), inline properties (status via StatusField, health via HealthField, owner via PersonField, target via TargetDateField), description (MarkdownEditor)
- **Updates** — placeholder (coming soon)
- **Projects** — table of linked projects with owner, health, decision/commitment counts

Right sidebar mirrors properties.

### Projects List

Projects for the active workspace, grouped by parent initiative. Group rows show initiative title, project count, and expand/collapse toggle. Filter popover for health. Scope tabs: All Projects / My Projects. Table columns: title (with lock icon for private), owner (PersonField avatar), health, active decision count, open commitment count.

### Project Detail

Execution detail for a project. Single scrollable page with decisions and commitments sections. Right sidebar toggle.

- **Inline properties** — HealthField, visibility (PropertySelect), owner (PropertySelect), parent initiative (InitiativeField)
- **Decisions** — EntityList with ref, title, circle name, and status

Right sidebar has: Properties, Signals (open commitments, rolled count, recent decisions), and People (private projects only — owner, subscribers, invite selector).

Follow/Unfollow button in header for public projects where user is not the owner.
