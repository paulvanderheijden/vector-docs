This page maps the relationships between all entities in Vector. Understanding these connections is key to understanding how the system fits together.

## Identity & access

| Relationship | Cardinality | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Person ↔ Workspace | many to many | Via WorkspaceMember; each membership has a role (Admin or Member) |
| Person → Workspace (lastActive) | 0 to 1 | Tracks the last workspace the person used |

## Structural relationships

| Relationship | Cardinality | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Workspace → WorkspaceMember | 1 to many | Each member has a role: Admin or Member |
| Workspace → Circle | 1 to many | Every circle belongs to a workspace |
| Workspace → Initiative | 1 to many | Every initiative belongs to a workspace |
| Workspace → Project | 1 to many | Every project belongs to a workspace |
| Workspace → Decision | 1 to many | Every decision belongs to a workspace |
| Workspace → Commitment | 1 to many | Every commitment belongs to a workspace |
| Initiative → Project | 1 to many | A project belongs to exactly one initiative |
| Person ↔ Team | many to many | People can be on multiple teams |
| Project ↔ Team | many to many | Teams can be involved in multiple projects (signal, not ownership) |
| Initiative ↔ Person (subscribers) | many to many | For restricted visibility |
| Project ↔ Person (subscribers) | many to many | For restricted visibility |
| Circle → CircleMember | 1 to many | Each member has a role: Member or Organizer |

## Decision system

| Relationship | Cardinality | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Circle → Decision | 1 to many | A decision lives in exactly one circle at a time |
| Person → Decision (sponsor) | 1 to many | A decision must have exactly one sponsor |
| Person → Decision (owner) | 0 to many | A decision has zero or one owner |
| Person → Decision (requestor) | 1 to many | A decision must have exactly one requestor |
| Initiative/Project → Decision | 0 to many | Optional context linkage |
| Decision → Decision (revisit) | 0 to 1 | Self-referential revisit chain |

## Commitment system

| Relationship | Cardinality | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Decision → Commitment | 0 to many | A decision can have zero or many commitments |
| Commitment → Decision | 0 to 1 | A commitment can be standalone (no parent decision) |
| Person → Commitment (owner) | 1 to many | A commitment must have exactly one owner |
| Circle → Commitment (review) | 1 to many | A commitment must have exactly one review circle |

## Session system

| Relationship | Cardinality | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Circle → Session | 1 to many | A circle has zero or many sessions |
| Session ↔ Decision | many to many | Decisions reviewed in a session |
| Session ↔ Commitment | many to many | Commitments reviewed in a session |
| Session ↔ Person (attendance) | many to many | Who attended the session |

## Project updates

| Relationship | Cardinality | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Project → Project Update | 1 to many | Zero or many updates per project |
| Person → Project Update (author) | 1 to many | Each update has exactly one author |

## Key design decisions

### Why Person is not workspace-scoped

A person can belong to multiple workspaces. Authentication is at the person level (JWT token), and workspace access is determined by membership. This means a single session can switch between workspaces without re-authenticating. The `lastActiveWorkspace` field stores which workspace to default to on next login.

### Why decisions live in exactly one circle

A decision needs a clear venue. If it could exist in multiple circles simultaneously, sponsorship and accountability become ambiguous.

### Why commitments can be standalone

Not every action item comes from a formal decision. Forums create ad-hoc commitments regularly. Forcing a parent decision would add friction without value.

### Why the revisit chain is self-referential

When a decision needs to be revisited, a new decision is created and linked to the original. This preserves the history of the original decision while keeping the new one in its own lifecycle with its own owner and age counter.
