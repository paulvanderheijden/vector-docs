This is the conceptual schema for Vector V1. It describes the entities and their fields — not a database implementation, but the design spec that drives the product.

## Entities

## Entity details

### Workspace

| Field  | Type   | Required |
| ------ | ------ | -------- |
| `name` | string | yes      |
| `slug` | string | yes      |
| `logo` | string | no       |

### Person

| Field      | Type   | Required |
| ---------- | ------ | -------- |
| `name`     | string | yes      |

### Circle

| Field         | Type             | Required |
| ------------- | ---------------- | -------- |

| `cadence`     | string           | yes      |
| `members`     | CircleMember[]   | yes      |

A **CircleMember** is `{ personId, role }` where role is `Member` or `Organizer`. Organizers are members with elevated rights — they are responsible for preparing sessions, setting the agenda, ensuring decisions are ready, and reviewing commitments before the meeting.

### Session

| Field           | Type         | Required |
| --------------- | ------------ | -------- |
| `number`        | integer (generated) | yes |

| `notes`         | markdown     | —        |
| `completed`     | boolean      | yes      |

Session numbers are auto-generated per circle, starting at 1. Each circle has its own independent sequence.

## Hard constraints (V1)

- A decision must have exactly **one sponsor**
- A decision must have exactly **one active forum**
- A commitment must have exactly **one owner**
- A commitment must have exactly **one review forum**
- A project must belong to exactly **one initiative**
- Restricted initiatives/projects: only subscribers + owner/lead can view

## Cut from V1

The following entities are deferred to a future version:

- **Portfolio** — replaced by visibility controls on initiatives and projects
- **Cycle** — deferred
- **Priority** — deferred
- **Goal** — deferred
