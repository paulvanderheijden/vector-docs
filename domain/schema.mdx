This is the conceptual schema for Vector V1. It describes the entities and their fields — not a database implementation, but the design spec that drives the product.

## Entities

| Entity             | Description                                                               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Workspace**      | The organization; people access it via membership                         |
| **Person**         | A user; can belong to multiple workspaces                                 |
| **Team**           | An organizational unit; people can belong to multiple teams               |
| **Circle**         | A recurring forum where decisions are routed and commitments are reviewed |
| **Session**        | A record that a circle actually met                                       |
| **Initiative**     | A strategic bet with status and target date                               |
| **Project**        | An execution container; belongs to exactly one initiative                 |
| **Decision**       | A direction-setting artifact routed through a circle                      |
| **Commitment**     | An execution artifact reviewed in a circle                                |
| **Project Update** | A status report on a project                                              |

## Entity details

### Workspace

| Field     | Type               | Required |
| --------- | ------------------ | -------- |
| `name`    | string             | yes      |
| `slug`    | string (unique)    | yes      |
| `logo`    | string             | no       |
| `members` | WorkspaceMember[]  | yes      |

A **WorkspaceMember** is `{ personId, role }` where role is:

| Value | Description |
|---|---|
| `Admin` | Can manage workspace settings, invite/remove people, create/edit circles, and manage all entities |
| `Member` | Can view and create entities within the workspace; cannot manage workspace settings or membership |

### Person

| Field                  | Type      | Required |
| ---------------------- | --------- | -------- |
| `name`                 | string    | yes      |
| `email`                | string    | yes      |
| `initials`             | string    | yes      |
| `lastActiveWorkspace`  | Workspace | no       |

A person is **not** workspace-scoped — they can belong to multiple workspaces via `WorkspaceMember`. Authentication is at the person level; workspace access is determined by membership.

### Circle

| Field         | Type             | Required |
| ------------- | ---------------- | -------- |
| `workspaceId` | Workspace        | yes      |
| `name`        | string           | yes      |
| `cadence`     | string           | yes      |
| `members`     | CircleMember[]   | yes      |

A **CircleMember** is `{ personId, role }` where role is:

| Value | Description |
|---|---|
| `Member` | Can see all circle content, be assigned as sponsor or commitment owner, and attend sessions |
| `Organizer` | All member capabilities, plus: manage session agendas, schedule decisions, and mark sessions as completed |

### Session

| Field           | Type         | Required |
| --------------- | ------------ | -------- |
| `number`        | integer (generated) | yes |
| `circleId`      | Circle       | yes      |
| `title`         | string       | yes      |
| `date`          | date         | yes      |
| `decisionIds`   | Decision[]   | —        |
| `commitmentIds` | Commitment[] | —        |
| `notes`         | markdown     | —        |
| `completed`     | boolean      | yes      |

Session numbers are auto-generated per circle, starting at 1. Each circle has its own independent sequence.

### Initiative

| `targetDate`   | string                              | yes      |

| `Scheduled` | Placed on a specific session's agenda. The sponsor has confirmed it's ready for discussion. |
| `Rolled` | Was on the agenda but not resolved in the session. Carries over to the next session — the age counter keeps ticking. |

A **Reference** is a file or link attached to a decision for context (e.g., a document, spreadsheet, or external URL).

## Hard constraints (V1)

- A decision must have exactly **one sponsor**
- A decision must have exactly **one active circle**
- A commitment must have exactly **one owner**
- A commitment must have exactly **one review circle**
- A project must belong to exactly **one initiative**
- Restricted initiatives/projects: only subscribers + owner/lead can view

## Cut from V1

The following entities are deferred to a future version:

- **Portfolio** — replaced by visibility controls on initiatives and projects
- **Cycle** — deferred
- **Priority** — deferred
- **Goal** — deferred
