description: "How a commitment flows from creation to delivery."

Commitments are the execution layer of Vector. Once a [decision is taken](/lifecycle/decision-lifecycle), commitments carry the work forward.

## The lifecycle

<Steps>
  <Step title="Commitment is created (Active)">
    A commitment is created — either from a taken decision or standalone. It has a clear outcome statement, a single owner, a due date, and a review forum.

    Status: **Active**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reviewed in sessions">
    The commitment appears on the agenda of its review circle's sessions. During each session, the forum checks progress:

    - Is it on track? Keep it **Active**.
    - Is there risk of slippage? Flag it as **At risk**.
    - Has it been completed? Mark it **Delivered**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="If due date passes: Rolled">
    If the due date passes without delivery, the commitment moves to **Rolled** status. It doesn't disappear — it visibly carries over to the next session.

    Rolled commitments create accountability pressure. The owner must explain why it slipped and when it will be delivered.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Delivered">
    The outcome has been completed. The commitment is marked **Delivered** and closed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Status transitions

| From | To | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| Active | At risk | Owner or reviewer flags potential slippage |
| Active | Delivered | Outcome completed |
| Active | Rolled | Due date passes without delivery |
| At risk | Active | Risk resolved, back on track |
| At risk | Delivered | Outcome completed despite risk |
| At risk | Rolled | Due date passes |
| Rolled | Active | New due date set, work resumes |
| Rolled | Delivered | Outcome completed after roll |

## The roll mechanic

The **roll** is a key concept in Vector. When a commitment misses its due date:

1. Status changes to **Rolled** — this is visible everywhere
2. The commitment carries over to the next session automatically
3. The forum must address it: set a new date, reassign, or escalate
4. The roll history is preserved — you can see how many times a commitment has rolled

Rolling is not failure. It's **visible accountability**. The system makes slippage impossible to hide, which creates the right pressure to either deliver or explicitly renegotiate.

## Standalone commitments

Not every commitment needs a parent decision. Forums can create commitments directly for:

- Action items from discussions
- Follow-ups from reviews
- Preparatory work for upcoming decisions

These standalone commitments follow the same lifecycle — they just don't have a decision reference.

## Review rhythm

Commitments are reviewed on the cadence of their review circle:

- **Weekly circles** — commitments are reviewed every week
- **Biweekly circles** — commitments are reviewed every two weeks
- **Monthly circles** — commitments are reviewed monthly

The cadence determines how quickly slippage becomes visible. A weekly circle catches problems faster than a monthly one.
