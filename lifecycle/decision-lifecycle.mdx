description: "How a decision flows from creation to closure."
---

Every decision in Vector follows a clear lifecycle. The system is designed so decisions move forward — and when they don't, the pressure becomes visible.

## The lifecycle

<Steps>
  <Step title="A need is raised">
    Someone identifies that a decision needs to be made. This could be a team lead whose project is blocked, an executive spotting a strategic fork, or a forum surfacing an unresolved question.

    The **requestor** frames the need: "We need to decide X because Y."
  </Step>
  <Step title="A decision is created (Draft)">
    The decision is created in Vector with a clear title. A **sponsor** is assigned — the circle member accountable for getting it prepared and resolved.

    At this stage the decision is a **Draft**. The sponsor gathers context, frames options, and prepares it for forum discussion.

    **The age counter starts ticking.**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Routed to a forum (Proposed)">
    The sponsor routes the decision to the appropriate [circle](/concepts/circles). It moves to **Proposed** status and is available for an upcoming session.

    The sponsor chooses the forum based on who needs to be in the room. A product decision goes to Product Forum. A cross-functional resource allocation goes to MT Weekly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Placed on the agenda (Scheduled)">
    The decision is placed on a specific session's agenda. It moves to **Scheduled** status. The sponsor has confirmed it's ready for discussion.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Discussed in session">
    The decision is discussed in a [session](/concepts/sessions). The forum reviews the context, debates options, and works toward resolution.

    Two outcomes are possible:
  </Step>
  <Step title="Outcome A: Taken">
    The forum makes the call. The decision moves to **Taken** status.

    The sponsor's job is now done. [Commitments](/concepts/commitments) are created to execute on the decision — each with its own owner and due date. The decision is closed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Outcome B: Rolled">
    The forum didn't resolve it in this session — it needs more time, more context, or more people. The decision moves to **Rolled** status and carries over to the next session.

    The age keeps ticking. Rolled decisions create visible pressure — the forum must address them.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## After a decision is taken

Once taken, the decision is closed. The system transitions from decision mode to execution mode:

1. **Commitments are created** — concrete outcomes with owners and due dates
2. **The sponsor's job ends** — they are no longer responsible
3. **Commitment owners take over** — they execute, report, and are reviewed in sessions
4. **If reality changes** — a new decision is raised, potentially as a "revisit" linked to the original

<Note>
  There are no zombie decisions in Vector. A decision is either actively moving through its lifecycle or it's been taken. If a taken decision needs revisiting, a new decision is created with an explicit revisit link.
</Note>

## Sponsor defaults

| Scenario | Default sponsor |
|---|---|
| Decision affects a specific initiative | A circle member close to that initiative |
| Decision raised by someone outside the circle | The circle organizer assigns a sponsor |
| Cross-cutting decision in MT | The CEO or relevant executive |

The requestor is **never** the default sponsor. The requestor creates pull; the sponsor ensures resolution.

## Age as pressure

The age counter is the primary forcing function. It's visible everywhere a decision appears:

| Age | Signal |
|---|---|
| 0-3 days | Fresh — expected for new decisions |
| 4-7 days | Normal — should be on a session agenda |
| 8-14 days | Aging — needs attention |
| 15+ days | Stale — something is wrong |

The exact thresholds depend on the decision's context and the circle's cadence, but the principle is universal: old decisions are a smell.
