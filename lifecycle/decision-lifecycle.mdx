description: "How a decision flows from creation to closure."
---

Every decision in Vector follows a clear lifecycle. The system is designed so decisions move forward — and when they don't, the pressure becomes visible.

## The lifecycle

<Steps>
  <Step title="A need is raised">
    Someone identifies that a decision needs to be made. This could be a team lead whose project is blocked, an executive spotting a strategic fork, or a circle surfacing an unresolved question.

    The **requestor** frames the need: "We need to decide X because Y."
  </Step>
  <Step title="A decision is created (Draft)">
    Any **workspace member** can create a decision — they become the requestor automatically. The decision can be routed to any circle, even one the requestor isn't a member of.

    At this stage the decision is a **Draft**. It is visible only to the requestor in My Items — it does not appear in circle views. The requestor gathers context, frames options, and prepares it for circle discussion. There is no age counter yet — the decision hasn't been formally submitted.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Formally submitted (Requested)">
    The **requestor** moves the decision to **Requested** status. The `requested_date` is auto-set to the current timestamp.

    **The age counter starts ticking.** The decision is now visible to circle members and available for an upcoming session.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Placed on the agenda (Scheduled)">
    The **circle chair** places the decision on a specific session's agenda. It moves to **Scheduled** status. The chair assigns a **sponsor** — the circle member who will prepare and drive the discussion in the session.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Discussed in session">
    The decision is discussed in a [session](/concepts/sessions). The sponsor presents the context, the circle debates options, and they work toward resolution.

    Two outcomes are possible:
  </Step>
  <Step title="Outcome A: Taken">
    The **circle chair** marks the decision as **Taken** and assigns an **owner** — the person accountable for the decision going forward.

    [Commitments](/concepts/commitments) are created to execute on the decision — each with its own owner and due date. The decision is closed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Outcome B: Rolled">
    The circle didn't resolve it in this session — it needs more time, more context, or more people. The **circle chair** moves the decision to **Rolled** status and it carries over to the next session.

    The age keeps ticking. Rolled decisions create visible pressure — the circle must address them.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## After a decision is taken

Once taken, the decision is closed. The system transitions from decision mode to execution mode:

1. **An owner is assigned** — the circle chair assigns the person who tracks whether the decision holds up over time
2. **Commitments are created** — any circle member can create commitments during the open session
3. **The sponsor's job ends** — they are no longer responsible
4. **Commitment owners take over** — they execute, report, and are reviewed in sessions
5. **If reality changes** — the decision owner raises a new decision as a "revisit" linked to the original

## Editing a non-Draft decision

Once a decision is past Draft, the description, discussion, and summary fields can be edited by the **sponsor**, **owner**, or **circle chair**. Only the circle chair can change status, assign roles, or supersede the decision.

<Note>
  There are no zombie decisions in Vector. A decision is either actively moving through its lifecycle or it's been taken. If a taken decision needs revisiting, a new decision is created with an explicit revisit link.
</Note>

## Status flow diagram

```
Draft → Requested → Scheduled → Taken
                              ↘ Rolled → (re-enters at Scheduled for the next session)

Any status → Superseded (when replaced by a revisit decision)
```

## When each role is set

| Role | Set at | Set by | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Requestor** | Draft created | Automatic (the creator) | Raised the need; gets informed of the outcome |
| **Sponsor** | Scheduled into session | Circle chair | Prepares and drives the decision in the session |
| **Owner** | Decision taken | Circle chair | Tracks long-term validity; can revoke the decision |

The requestor is **never** the default sponsor. The requestor creates pull; the sponsor ensures resolution.

Both sponsor and owner must be members of the decision's circle.

## Age as pressure

The age counter starts when the decision moves to **Requested** — not when the draft is created. It's visible everywhere a decision appears:

| Age | Signal |
|---|---|
| 0-3 days | Fresh — expected for new decisions |
| 4-7 days | Normal — should be on a session agenda |
| 8-14 days | Aging — needs attention |
| 15+ days | Stale — something is wrong |

The exact thresholds depend on the decision's context and the circle's cadence, but the principle is universal: old decisions are a smell.
