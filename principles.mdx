Vector is opinionated. These principles inform every design decision in the product.

## 1. Decisions and commitments are the atomic units of leadership

Most tools organize work around tasks, tickets, or documents. Vector organizes around **decisions** (direction) and **commitments** (execution). Everything else — meetings, forums, initiatives — exists to support these two units.

## 2. The system punishes neglect

Decisions have an age counter that starts ticking the moment they're created. Commitments have due dates that turn red when missed. Sessions track attendance and agenda coverage. There are no reminders — just visible decay.

- **Decisions age** — a 30-day-old draft is a failure signal
- **Commitments roll** — a missed due date changes status, not quietly, but visibly
- **Meetings degrade** — skipped sessions, empty agendas, and absent members all show

## 3. Ownership is explicit and singular

Every decision has exactly one sponsor. Every commitment has exactly one owner. There is no shared ownership, no "the team owns this." If something stalls, there is one person who should feel uncomfortable.

## 4. Closure over monitoring

The sponsor's job ends when the decision is taken. They don't monitor it forever. Commitments take over from there. If reality changes, a new decision is raised with a new owner. This prevents zombie decisions and diffused responsibility.

## 5. Forums are the routing layer

Decisions don't float in space — they're routed through forums (circles) where the right people meet at the right cadence. The forum is where a decision gets prepared, debated, and taken. It's not a notification channel; it's the decision-making venue.

## 6. Match Linear's density

Vector is built for people who work fast. Every screen should show maximum information at minimum space. No onboarding wizards, no empty states with illustrations, no unnecessary whitespace. Data-dense, keyboard-friendly, fast.
