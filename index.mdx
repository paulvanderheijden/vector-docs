title: "What is Vector?"
description: "A decision- and commitment-centric operating system for leadership teams."
---

Vector is an operating system for leadership teams. It replaces scattered meeting notes, lost Slack threads, and forgotten follow-ups with two atomic units: **Decisions** and **Commitments**.

Think of it as **Linear for Management** — the same density and speed, applied to how leadership teams actually work: making decisions, assigning commitments, and holding each other accountable.

## Who is Vector for?

Vector is built for **CEOs and COOs of scale-ups** (50-300 employees) who need to:

- Track every decision made across leadership circles
- Ensure commitments are owned, reviewed, and delivered
- See at a glance what's stalling, what's at risk, and what needs their attention

## The two atomic units

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Decisions" icon="scale-balanced" href="/concepts/decisions">
    Direction-setting artifacts. A decision answers "what did we decide?" and routes through a circle until it's taken.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Commitments" icon="handshake" href="/concepts/commitments">
    Execution artifacts. A commitment answers "who will do what by when?" and is reviewed in a circle until it's delivered.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## Structural concepts

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Circles" icon="circle-nodes" href="/concepts/circles">
    Recurring forums where decisions are routed and commitments are reviewed. Each circle has a cadence, members, and a purpose.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Sessions" icon="comments" href="/concepts/sessions">
    Records of when a circle actually met. Sessions contain the decisions discussed and commitments reviewed.
  </Card>
</Columns>

<Card title="Initiatives & Projects" icon="diagram-project" href="/concepts/initiatives-and-projects" horizontal>
  Strategic bets and their execution containers. Decisions and commitments can be linked to initiatives and projects for context.
</Card>

## Core principle

**The system punishes neglect.** Decisions age. Commitments roll. Meetings degrade. Vector makes the cost of inaction visible — not through notifications, but through the natural pressure of time.

<Card title="Decision Lifecycle" icon="arrows-spin" href="/lifecycle/decision-lifecycle" horizontal>
  Understand how a decision flows from draft to taken, and what happens at each stage.
